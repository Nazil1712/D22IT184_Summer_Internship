## Introduction

This repository documents the progress and outcomes of my summer internship in 2024 at [ScaleCapacity](https://www.scalecapacity.com/). My roll number is **D22IT184**. Throughout this internship, I engaged in various tasks to enhance my skills and contribute to meaningful work.

## Projects

### Project 1: KEMS ( KnightScope Emergency Management System )
- **Objective:** To manage all emergency devices and their functionalities.
- **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JS, PostgreSQL, jQuery.
- **Status:** Currently in progress, with ongoing tasks and updates being handled as instructed by my senior colleague.
- **Description:** The KEMS (Knight Scope Emergency System) project at ScaleCapacity focuses on enhancing emergency response through the deployment of callboxes worldwide. A callbox is a device used by individuals to report accidents or emergencies, ensuring swift assistance. The project involves mapping callbox locations, monitoring their status, integrating cameras, and generating comprehensive reports, such as monthly active callbox reports and system availability history. An admin panel is also developed to manage these callboxes efficiently. My role includes completing tasks and implementing changes as directed by my senior colleague.

## Start Of Internship 

### Week-1
- **Induction :** 
    - My internship at ScaleCapacity began with an induction meeting where Maulik Sir provided a brief overview of the company. 
    - During this meeting, I, along with other selected students, introduced ourselves. Maulik Sir also shared essential information and guidelines necessary for our successful integration into the company. 
    - This initial session set the foundation for the work and collaboration that would follow in the subsequent weeks.


- **Setup & Installation :** 
    - Following the induction, I received an AWS account from the company and logged in. I then cloned the project repository from AWS. To set up my development environment, I installed 
    - XAMPP, <img src="./xampp.png" width="55px"/>
    - PostgreSQL  ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=flat&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
    - pgAdmin. 

    - This setup was crucial for managing and interacting with the database and running the local development server.



### Week-2
- **Database Import and running project :**
    - In the second week, I focused on setting up the project environment and resolving initial issues. 
    - I imported the project database and learned how to run the project locally using the 
    command 
    ```bash
     sls offline start --stage local
    ```
    - This involved understanding and working with Serverless (sls). During this process, I encountered and solved various errors and issues related to the Serverless framework, which helped me gain practical troubleshooting experience.


    -  I have set up specific branches to facilitate organized development and feature implementation based on instructions from my senior colleague. Here is an overview of the branch setup:


    1. To check current branch
    ```bash
        git branch
    ```

    2. To create a new branch
    ```bash
        git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```

    3. To navigate to respective branch
    ```bash
        git checkout <branch-name>
    ```
