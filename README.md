## Start Of Internship 

### 1️⃣ Week 1
- **Induction :** My internship at ScaleCapacity began with an induction meeting where Maulik Sir provided a brief overview of the company. During this meeting, I, along with other selected students, introduced ourselves. Maulik Sir also shared essential information and guidelines necessary for our successful integration into the company. This initial session set the foundation for the work and collaboration that would follow in the subsequent weeks.


- **Setup & Installation :** 
    - Following the induction, I received an AWS account from the company and logged in. I then cloned the project repository from AWS. To set up my development environment, I installed

    - This setup was crucial for managing and interacting with the database and running the local development server.
